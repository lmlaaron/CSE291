Hello world!
Large-scale in-memory object caches such as memcached
are widely used to accelerate popular web sites and to reduce
burden on backend databases. Yet current cache systems give
cache operators limited information on what resources are
required to optimally accommodate the present workload.
This paper focuses on a key question for cache operators: how
much total memory should be allocated to the in-memory
cache tier to achieve desired performance?
